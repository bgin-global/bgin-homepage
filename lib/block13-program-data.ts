            "   A) The Asset Classification Perspective: Reliance on a Central Party",
            "      - As a network decentralizes, its success becomes less dependent on managerial or entrepreneurial efforts of any single entity. This can weaken the case for classifying the asset as a regulated financial instrument or alter disclosure requirements.",
            "   B) The Enforcement Perspective: Identifying an Accountable Party",
            "      - Market integrity rules (fraud prevention, AML/CFT, consumer protection) rely on an accountable party who can be held responsible for compliance. In sufficiently decentralized systems, no such central body exists, making traditional enforcement difficult.",
            "   • Note: Point A concerns the asset's nature; Point B addresses the existence of a responsible operator—distinct but related.",
            "   • Key Question: Does this capture the regulatory significance of decentralization? Is it appropriate to incentivize decentralization if it makes traditional investor protection mechanisms more difficult to apply?",

            "   • Vitalik Buterin's three dimensions of decentralization:",

            "      - Architectural Decentralization: How many physical computers make up the system?",
            "      - Logical Decentralization: Single unified entity or many distinct, interacting parts?",
            "   • Key Question: Should we focus on 'governance decentralization' as it has the most direct bearing on regulatory questions?",
            "",
            "4. Discussion Point 3: A Practical Framework for Gauging Governance Decentralization",
            "   • Two overarching questions:",
            "      - What technical indicators demonstrate a network's viability is driven by a diverse community, not a core team?",
            "      - What characteristics enable reliable function without a central administrator?",
            "   A) The Walk-Away Test",
            "      - If the core development team disappeared tomorrow, could the network continue to function and could users access their assets?",
            "      - Key Question: Is this test a valid starting point for evaluation?",
            "   B) Identifying Potential Points of Centralization",
            "      - Protocol Upgrade Authority: Who decides and implements code changes? (admin key, multi-sig, on-chain governance)",
            "      - Emergency Powers: Can any party unilaterally halt the network or freeze user assets?",
            "      - Treasury Management: Who controls the treasury and how are funds spent?",
            "      - Infrastructure Diversity: Dependency on single software client or provider for critical infrastructure?",
            "      - Consensus Influence: Power concentration among validators, miners, or token holders? (Nakamoto Coefficient, token distribution)",
            "      - External Dependencies: Reliance on centralized services (oracles, bridges) creating single points of failure?",
            "      - Key Question: What other centralization points should be considered? Which are most critical? How to synthesize into holistic assessment?",
            "   C) Accounting for Dynamic Events",
            "      - Hard forks can create networks with different governance structures. Many projects pursue 'progressive decentralization,' gradually ceding control over time.",
