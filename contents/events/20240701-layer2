## Background

Blockchain Governance Initiative Network (BGIN) is a non-profit organization that creates neutral forums for in-depth discussions among all stakeholders, documenting a common language to establish shared understanding. It also fosters innovation, best practices, and standards for blockchain governance in operational, regulatory, and technical spheres.
We hold the first layer 2 meetup the purpose of which is to discuss our project topics with people in a different community and expand our community through networking. 

## About this event

​BGIN has held global Block conferences two or three times a year since its founding in 2020. Block Conferences represent the premier forum for multi-stakeholder discussions provided by BGIN. The Blockchain Center of the University of Zurich (https://www.blockchain.uzh.ch/) hosted Block #6 in June 2022. In addition to Block Conferences, BGIN will organize Layer2 Meetups to exchange ideas with various community hubs across the globe openly. The  Blockchain Center of the University of Zurich will be hosting the first Layer2 Meetup on July 1st, 2024. 
While the program is hybrid, we strongly suggest people participate in the program onsite, as there will be unique networking opportunities. Our networking lunch will be co-hosted by the Association for Women in Crypto (www.womenincrypto.org).
