description: "As the first general meeting of BGIN, its main goal is setting up a common stage of multi-stakeholder discussion. After the agreement at G20 last year, several conferences/meetings were organized to gather multi-stakeholders including developers and regulators who never collaborated before. With leveraging those discussions, we aim to establish organization and processes of multi-stakeholder discussions suitable for permissionless blockchain ecosystems. The agenda includes discussion of BGIN’s multi-stakeholder governance, discussion of the essential work items on identity, privacy and key management. BGIN’s future roadmap is also discussed."
